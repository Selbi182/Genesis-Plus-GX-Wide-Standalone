What is "Sonic ERaZor"?
================================

Sonic ERaZor is a complete reinvention of Sonic 1 for the Sega Mega Drive: a chaotic, cinematic,
and often absurd remix that throws out most of the original game's rules in favor of unpredictable
spectacle. It's been described as "What if Michael Bay directed Sonic 1?" due to its very generous
use of explosions.

Originally released in 2010, ERaZor began as a messy, hard-as-nails curiosity. Now, 15 years later,
it has evolved into a carefully rebalanced, polished, and highly replayable full-game experience.
The current version, Sonic ERaZor 8, is the result of a massive two-part overhaul that started in
late 2023 and has culminated in 2025 with a full widescreen engine rebuild, revamped visuals,
accessibility improvements, and tons of quality-of-life additions.

Whether you're here for secrets, speedrunning, or just pure chaos: this game is built to give you
a good time with lots of replay value!

Overview:
- 2 unique difficulties: Casual and Frantic Mode, both being delicately handcrafted and wildly
  different experiences to allow everyone to get started with the game while also rewarding practice!
- 8 unique levels: Inspired and based on the original Sonic 1 levels, each one comes with its own
  gimmick, theme, and challenge
- Custom mechanics: From Inhuman Mode to Space Golf, from lethal cinematic black bars to intense
  escape sequences; this isn't a typical Sonic game anymore
- Cinematic flair: Lots of cutscenes, stylized transitions, and story text screens that aren't shy
  to break the fourth wall and give you a good laugh
- Tons of secrets: Unlockable powers, alternate endings, and easter eggs (some obvious, some hidden)
- And also: a save select with three slots, a ton of options to customize your experience to your
  liking, a custom sound test, and so much more...

This game has evolved so far beyond a simple ROM hack that it started to play footsies with the
definition of original fan game. This is no more apparent than with the custom build to support
unencumbered 16:9 widescreen support! It's actually insane what spectacle you can squeeze out of
that old Mega Drive, given the right aspect ratio.

All in all, Sonic ERaZor is more than just a novelty ROM hack, it's the result of 15 years of
passion, experimentation, and community feedback. Have fun!


================================
What is the "DX" version?
================================

Sonic ERaZor DX is a port of the Sonic 1 ROM hack "Sonic ERaZor 8.1" as a standalone,
self-contained Microsoft Windows EXE file. It runs on a custom Sega Mega Drive emulator to play the
game in glorious 16:9 widescreen with enhancements not available on the original hardware.

For 15 years, ERaZor was only available as a ROM file, which meant you had to provide your own
emulator. The widescreen version was especially finicky, as it only worked through RetroArch with
the "Genesis Plus GX Wide" core, which was daunting for anyone unfamiliar with it.

This special edition fixes this: no setup necessary, just download and begin playing right away!

Huge thanks go out to heyjoeway for their "Sonic 2 Community Cut" emulator powering this port
(which is itself a fork of Genesis Plus GX). It needed a few modifications to make ERaZor work
flawlessly, but the majority of the heavy lifting was already done. You can find it here:
